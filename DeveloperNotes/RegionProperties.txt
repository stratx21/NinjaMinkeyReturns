Region properties:: R[#] :: 
See previous ones
Two numbers with a comma for size; width and height
If any changes are made make sure to change these numbers as well
The single digit numbers have a zero in front of them for the purpose of making it visually easy to understand (somewhat)

for top down map::
00=regular ground
01=tree(unwalkable) 
02=trigger spot*
03=building

* - for checking trigger spots, if the player walks into the trigger spot then go through an arraylist of triggers to check which one

** IMPORTANT:: put trees out in the map on the edges so that the player can go to the edges and there wont be an indexOutOfBounds Exception

note to self for near future:: add in more txt file data for each region, and add data for trigger spots (maybe add on the current one with map info)
