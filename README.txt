[IN-GAME PURPOSE]
	The game's focus is on the main character, the minkey, who has been oppressed by sloths and the sloths' minions for years. Just recently
		the Sloths have "accidently" crashed an international satellite station on which the minkeys and sloths worked together for years. 
		The crash destroyed the main character's farm and forced him to take up a magical banana he found from the wreckage and two
		swords that he acquired when he was just a young minkey to fight off his enemies!

==================================

[ADVICE]
	-If the game fails to import external resources such as images or information files then try re-installing the program.
	-If the game's graphical representation seems to be glitching then try moving the window back and forth a couple times. 
	-The bar in the top left that appears in the in game menu and in side view game play mode is your health. The red part
		is what is reminaing and the grey is the part that has been lost. 
	-There are two cheat codes in top down mode. They are used by typing the given strings while in movement mode.
		-"2Q==" - > walk through walls
		-"CUPINE" - > stop random AI spawning

==================================

[SAVING]
	Save by hitting P in top down game play mode to access the menu, then choose save by moving towards the Save option with A or D. Use J

		Load option in order to find your save file. If the save file is invalid then the program will start a new game.
