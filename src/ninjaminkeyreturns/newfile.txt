17 x length
9 y length
50x50 pixels per square (for original pixel dimensions)


for map::
00=regular ground
01=tree(unwalkable) 
02=trigger spot*


* - for checking trigger spots, if the player walks into the trigger spot then go through an arraylist of triggers to check which one

note to self for near future:: add in more txt file data for each region, and add data for trigger spots (maybe add on the current one with map info)


Trigger spots data txt info::
1st: int: region to go to (if not a region trigger then the value is -1)
2nd: int: x location value 1
3rd: int: y location value 1
4th: int: x location value 2
5th: int: y location value 2
